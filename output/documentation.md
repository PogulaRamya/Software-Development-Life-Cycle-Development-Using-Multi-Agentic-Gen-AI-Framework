# Python Function Documentation: add_numbers

## Overview
The presented code describes a concise Python function named `add_numbers` that performs an addition operation on two numbers and returns the result. This function is designed to be simple, efficient, and easily integrable into larger systems, and adheres to the PEP 8 standards. 

## Function add_numbers

### Purpose
The function's purpose is to accept two numbers, carry out an addition operation, and return the sum. The function also includes checks to ensure that the input arguments are either of type int or float and raises a TypeError if they are not.

### Input Parameters
- `number1 (float)`: This is the first number to add. It is expected to be a number (either int or float).
- `number2 (float)`: This is the second number to add. It is also expected to be a number (either int or float).

### Return Values
`float`: The function returns the sum of `number1` and `number2` as a float.

### Exceptions Raised
- `TypeError`: This exception is raised if any of the input arguments are not numbers (either int or float).

### Key Logic
1. The function checks if both `number1` and `number2` are numbers, by using the `isinstance()` function against the tuple `(int, float)`. If this check fails, it raises a TypeError.
2. If the check passes, the function calculates the sum of `number1` and `number2` and assigns it to `sum_of_numbers`.
3. The function then returns `sum_of_numbers`.

## Usage Examples and Output
```python
print(add_numbers(2, 3))  # Output: 5
print(add_numbers(-1, 5))  # Output: 4
print(add_numbers(2.5, 3.5))  # Output: 6.0
print(add_numbers("2", 3))  # Raises TypeError
```

The function can also be used in more complex scenarios such as adding numbers from two lists:

```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
for (num1, num2) in zip(list1, list2):
    print(add_numbers(num1, num2))  # Outputs the sum of the numbers in the two lists
```

## Dependencies, Configuration Requirements, and Setup Instructions
The `add_numbers` function does not rely on any external Python packages or libraries. It uses only the built-in Python features, so there are no special installation or setup requirements. 

## Getting Started
To use this function in your own application, simply copy the `add_numbers` function into your script. Once copied, you can call the function wherever you need to perform an addition operation with two numbers.
